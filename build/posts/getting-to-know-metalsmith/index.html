        <p>There are dozens of static site generators out there. The most popular is probably <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, and for good reasons! It’s super easy to set up, has a lot of great features built in and there are a loads of plugins floating around. It’s also the engine powering <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>, GitHub’s static site hosting for projects and users (this site too, is hosted on GH-Pages, you can find the source code <a href="https://github.com/RobinThrift/RobinThrift.com">here</a>). Static sites make it super easy to version control your site and also let others contribute to your site (fork it and fix my typos ;) ), as well as learn from it.</p>
<div class="side-note">I have started writing the tutorials:
    - <a href="http://www.robinthrift.com/posts/metalsmith-part-1-setting-up-the-forge/">Part 1</a>
    - <a href="http://www.robinthrift.com/posts/metalsmith-part-2-shaping-the-metal/">Part 2</a>
    - <a href="http://www.robinthrift.com/posts/metalsmith-part-3-refining-our-tools/">Part 3</a>
</div>

<p>I built a few websites using Jekyll, but as my ruby-fu&trade; is quite limited I had a few problems when it came to plugins, especially developing my own, also I didn’t like to depend on ruby, but I guess that’s just me being the JS guy I am. Although I plan on learning ruby in-depth at some stage, I’m not there yet. Also I simply wanted to try something new, preferably JavaScript based.</p>
<p>Recently I’ve been using <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp.js</a> for all of my build scripts and I thought about using that. While I certainly could have done so, I don’t think it would have been very elegant. I like the way Gulp works, for projects like web apps, as it’s very flexible. For static sites/blogs however, it didn’t feel quite right. Of course there are tons of JS-based static site generators out there, but most weren’t quite what I was looking for. <a href="http://assemble.io/">Assemble.io</a> seems quite powerful but I couldn’t quite get myself to like it. I don’t think the structure of the website/docs are very good for beginners.</p>
<p>This is were Metalsmith comes in.</p>
<p>###Forging with JavaScript</p>
<p><a href="http://www.metalsmith.io/">Metalsmith</a> by the guys over at <a href="https://segment.io/">Segment.io</a> is “an extremely simple, pluggable static site generator”. What that means is, is that everything is a plugin. There’s a very small core which creates a list of files for your plugins to work with (similar to Gulp). You give it a source directory and then tell it which plugins to use; if you know <a href="http://expressjs.com/">express.js</a> or have used Gulp before, this will look very familiar:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">Metalsmith<span class="hljs-comment">(__dirname)</span>
    .use<span class="hljs-comment">(markdown()</span>)
    .use<span class="hljs-comment">(templates('handlebars')</span>)
    .build<span class="hljs-comment">()</span>;
</code></pre>
<p>The first line simply creates a new instance of the Metalsmith object which looks for a folder named <code>src</code> in the given directory, <code>__dirname/src</code> in this case. We then specify two plugins that will process the input files found in the source directory. The fist one is <code>markdown()</code>, which processes markdown files (eg *.md) and converts them into .html files. </p>
<p>Metalsmith will also parse any YAML front-matter at the top of every file, which acts as metadata, e. g. title, date and template.</p>
<p>The second plugin is <code>templates()</code>, a thin wrapper on top of <a href="https://github.com/visionmedia/consolidate.js">consolidate.js</a> used to render the templates specified in the YAML front-matter. The argument you pass in is the engine that consolidate.js will use, so you can use any templating engine you like, i. e. Jade, Handlebars, Swig, etc.</p>
<p>Immediately you can see how flexible and modular Metalsmith is, while at the same time being elegant and very, very easy to develop for and work with.</p>
<p>In this series I will go over my experiences with Metalsmith and how I built this website. I want to cover everything from simple beginner topics like file structure to more advanced usage and plugin development, like my <a href="https://github.com/RobinThrift/metalsmith-paginate">pagination plugin</a>.</p>
<p>Join me next time when I will go over the file structure and basic setup.</p>
