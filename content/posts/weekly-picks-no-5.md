These are programming and non-programming things I found interesting this past week (11.04.16 - 17.04.16):

- [BSD for Linux Users](http://www.over-yonder.net/~fullermd/rants/bsd4linux/01): Although a bit dated, it's still an excellent essay by Matt Fuller on the differences both on the technical and philosophical aspects of BSDs and Linux.
- [Passive event listeners](https://github.com/WICG/EventListenerOptions/blob/gh-pages/explainer.md): a new DOM API proposal that should help with performance when using scroll handlers (especially on mobile).
- [Table for two: Our favorite two-player board games onby Aaron Zimmerman on Ars](http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/04/table-for-two-our-favorite-two-player-board-games-2/)
