These are programming and non-programming things I found interesting this past week (18.04.16 - 24.04.16):

- [Rolling Random Romans](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/rolling-random-romans) by [JoÃ«l Quenneville](https://twitter.com/joelquen): Excellent little tutorial on Elm.
- [Launching Mission Control Day (part 1)](https://slackhq.com/launching-mission-control-day-part-1-a6053adbd522)
