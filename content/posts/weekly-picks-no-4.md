These are programming and non-programming things I found interesting this past week (28.03.16 - 03.04.16):

- This should totally be a thing: https://twitter.com/davechenell/status/710549108692541440
- [String Types in Rust](http://www.suspectsemantics.com/blog/2016/03/27/string-types-in-rust/) by Andrew Brinker
- [S3Git](https://github.com/s3git/s3git) is "git for Cloud Storage", a clever little tool, that allows one to easily sync files with "distributed, decentralized and versioned repositories". It uses the *BLAKE2 Tree Hashing* Algorithm for both deduplicated and hydrated storage
- [Wekan](https://wekan.io/): I've been using Wekan for a while now, and absolutely love it. It's essentially a Trello clone, but that's not a bad thing, as it has the distinct advantage, that you can host it yourself. I use it for all my side projects and it has helped me massively.
