These are programming and non-programming things I found interesting this past week (25.01.16 - 31.01.16) and why:

- [github.com/zeithq/micro](https://github.com/zeithq/micro)
    - Very intersting micro services library with a beautifully minimalistic API. An excellent example for good APIs.
- [Typescript 1.8 Beta](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/typescript/archive/2016/01/28/announcing-typescript-1-8-beta.aspx)
    - I'm a huge fan of Typescript and the 1.8 release will make it even better, allowing for easier JS and TS interop. I'm looking forward to using it.
- [Alduin Colourscheme](https://github.com/AlessandroYorba/Alduin)
    - I've been using [base16-ocean (light and dark)](http://chriskempson.github.io/base16/#ocean) up until now, but I instantly fell in love with this colourscheme, and am now using it both for my terminal as well as vim.

- [ArcadeRS](http://jadpole.github.io/arcaders/arcaders-1-0/)
    - An excellent and very detailed tutorial on how to write a game in Rust and generally a great Rust intro.
- [preact](https://github.com/developit/preact)
    - "⚡️ Fast 3kb React alternative with the same ES6 API. Components &amp; Virtual DOM". Looks very promising and with TS 1.8's new option `--reactNamespac` this can even be used in TS withough much pain.
