      <description>These are programming and non-programming things I found interesting this past week (11.04.16 - 17.04.16):
BSD for Linux Users: Although a bit dated, it&amp;rsquo;s still an excellent essay by Matt Fuller on the differences both on the technical and philosophical aspects of BSDs and Linux. Passive event listeners: a new DOM API proposal that should help with performance when using scroll handlers (especially on mobile). Table for two: Our favorite two-player board games onby Aaron Zimmerman on Ars </description>

      <description>These are programming and non-programming things I found interesting this past week (28.03.16 - 03.04.16):
This should totally be a thing: https://twitter.com/davechenell/status/710549108692541440 String Types in Rust by Andrew Brinker S3Git is &amp;ldquo;git for Cloud Storage&amp;rdquo;, a clever little tool, that allows one to easily sync files with &amp;ldquo;distributed, decentralized and versioned repositories&amp;rdquo;. It uses the BLAKE2 Tree Hashing Algorithm for both deduplicated and hydrated storage Wekan: I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Wekan for a while now, and absolutely love it.</description>

      <description>These are programming and non-programming things I found interesting this past week (25.01.16 - 31.01.16) and why:
github.com/zeithq/micro Very intersting micro services library with a beautifully minimalistic API. An excellent example for good APIs. Typescript 1.8 Beta I&amp;rsquo;m a huge fan of Typescript and the 1.8 release will make it even better, allowing for easier JS and TS interop. I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to using it. Alduin Colourscheme I&amp;rsquo;ve been using base16-ocean (light and dark) up until now, but I instantly fell in love with this colourscheme, and am now using it both for my terminal as well as vim.</description>

      <description>These are programming and non-programming things I found interesting this past week (14.12.15 - 20.12.15) and why:
Intel NUC I bought this little barebones PC along with a 120GB SSD and 8GB RAM to be used as a simple home server. So far, I have nothing but good things to say about this little machine. Installing Ubuntu Server 14.04 LTS went without a hitch and Docker runs like a charm. It can easly handle anything I throw at it.</description>

Golang Examples Learning a new language, and especially one with so many interesting features, is difficult without good examples. Gyver A clever little tool that helps you organize your thoughts and ideas or just gives you inspiration. Little Secret by Nikki Yanofsky Note, I found them this week, it does not mean they are new this week.</description>
