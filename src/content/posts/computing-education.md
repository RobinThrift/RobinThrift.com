Recently I have found myself thinking a lot about, how we teach younger generations computing. You know, that thing that powers (and controls) our entire life!

And after talking to friends and family about my thoughts (both computer science students and non-technical people) and after stumbling over [Ross Penman](https://twitter.com/PenmanRoss)'s [article](http://rosspenman.com/computing-education/) about computing education in Scotland, I decided to go ahead and bring my thoughts to paper.

A quick note: I am from Germany, I was born in Hannover and went to school there, so I can only report from my personal experience. 

There's only one way to describe the computing education here in Lower Saxony: poor to non-existent. Sure, even I (about 10 years ago) was thought how to use Word or PowerPoint, but that's it. That's like showing someone how to drive in first gear, but not how to switch gears once in motion. You might as well not bother, unless you only ever want to drive in a car park. And just to make myself clear, by computing education, I do **not** mean hard core computer science. An average user does not need to know, how to write a compiler in assembler, what a D-Flip-Flop is, or the exact specs of low level protocols. Like driving instructors don't teach you the chemical reactions, that make your engine go, or physical formulas to calculate friction.

But(!), most pupils will probably learn how an [Otto engine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_engine) works in physics class. So we do learn the basics. Like we learn the basics of maths or biology. School is supposed to provide a general education, covering a wide spectrum, giving the students a good general understanding of the world. And computers, like cars or ethics are a part of this world. Very few people will describe their car as "magic", yet when it comes to computers, it's a black box, like a magic hat that spits out white rabbits at the flick of the wrist. And I don't blame them! Especially with modern smartphones, it must seem like magic to someone with no understanding of electronics or computer science. 

This lack of education causes two big problems: missed opportunities and stupid users. Sure, most software engineers complain about the stupidity of their users, but imagine, if an average user could script, and use the command line. Programmers are all about automation; it has almost become a competition. So if a normal user could use the same task runners or scripts, wouldn't they profit too? Most certainly! Thousands of hours must be waisted every day manually entering the numbers from an Excel spreadsheet into a calculator. While VisualBasic certainly isn't the best thing since sliced bread, it's very usable in Excel, but most people won't go near it, simply because it's "too complicated". Teaching yourself how to drive, do maths or physics isn't easy either. That's why we have teachers! 

Let me bring up another example of how normal people could profit. Like many people, I am an amateur photographer, and I take a lot of pictures, often going days without loading them off onto a computer. I just forget most of the time, but sometimes you can't transfer them because you are on holiday or out of town. Usually most events and outings will take place on one day, so wouldn't it be nice, if you had a simple tool, that does that organisation for you, without needing a fully blown image manager or having to manually copy the files? Easy enough if you know how to program a little; quickly write a little script and done. All your photos organized by year, month and then day. I wrote such a script, you can find it [here](https://github.com/RobinThrift/Simple-File-by-Date-Sorter). 

One last point before I end this jumbled mess of words. I think teaching children logical thinking could potentially help them with maths or physics, subjects that a lot of pupils have troubles with.

If you read up to here, thank you! I know this is not the most organized of posts, I just wanted to write down my thoughts (and ideas). I'll probably to a second, more structured version of this soon. 

Nevertheless here's what I propose (probably not complete):

###TL;DR

- Teach how computers work on a very superficial level (but using electronics)
- Teach [Boolean algebra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra) (it's really not that hard, but teaches you a lot)
- Teach practical programming (no [OOP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) just useful scripting)
- Replace Java with Go (killing the frustration (and no OOP!))

But most of important of all: stop raising stupid, uneducated users!
