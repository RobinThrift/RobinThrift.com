These are programming and non-programming things I found interesting this past week (14.12.15 - 20.12.15) and why:


- Intel NUC
    - I bought this little barebones PC along with a 120GB SSD and 8GB RAM to be used as a simple home server. So far, I have nothing but good things to say about this little machine. Installing Ubuntu Server 14.04 LTS went without a hitch and Docker runs like a charm. It can easly handle anything I throw at it. The only thing I haven't tried so far is running a CI Server, but I'm sure it'll do just fine.
    - Amazon [US](http://www.amazon.com/Intel-NUC5i3RYH-Core-120GB-BOXNUC5i3RYH/dp/B00TG6GOVI/ref=sr_1_fkmr1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1450617696&sr=8-2-fkmr1&keywords=Intel+BB+NUC5i3RYH) | [UK](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Intel-Computing-NUC5i3RYH-Barebone-PC/dp/B00S1IQHKK/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1450617724&sr=8-1&keywords=intel+nuc+NUC5i3RYH) | [DE](http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B00S1IQHKK?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00)
- Chocolate Coated Coffee Beans
    - I'm no coffee expert but I do like a nice, richt, earthy coffee, and after hearing about these, I had to try them, and I like them a lot.
- [Orient DB](http://orientdb.com/orientdb/)
    - I've been thinking a lot about databases recently, and how we usually store our data. I've been looking at graph data bases and NoSQL, and this one cought my eye. I will keep a close eye on this one.
- Test Runners:
    - In recent weeks I've been working on our testing infrastructure at work. I think there's a lot of room for innovation in test runner in the JS world, specifically when looking at integration tests and running tests decoupled from the system that is initiating the tests, i. e. on an iPhone Simulator for React Native. [Ava](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ava) is very interesting but only
        deals with the problem of concurrency.
- Fetching Data (SPAs):
    - While systems like GraphQL and Netflix's Falcor are interesting, they're not the end-all-solution. [react-refetch](https://engineering.heroku.com/blogs/2015-12-16-react-refetch/) is an interesting approach, however still doesn't quite satisfy my needs... I guess some more thinking and tinkering is required...


Note, I found them this week, it does not mean they are new this week.
