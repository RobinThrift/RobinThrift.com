These are programming and non-programming things I found interesting this past week (10.11.14 - 23.11.14) and why:

- [Golang Examples](http://golang-examples.tumblr.com/)
    - Learning a new language, and especially one with so many interesting features, is difficult without good examples.
- [Gyver](https://github.com/reimertz/gyver)
    - A clever little tool that helps you organize your thoughts and ideas or just gives you inspiration.
- [Little Secret by Nikki Yanofsky](http://www.amazon.com/Little-Secret-Nikki-Yanofsky/dp/B00N63SU96/ref=sr_1_1?s=dmusic&ie=UTF8&qid=1416313842&sr=1-1&keywords=Little+Secret)



Note, I found them this week, it does not mean they are new this week.
